Why Leather
-----------

Leather is an incredible material. It is strong, flexible (literally as well as figuratively), and hard-wearing. It has an aesthetic that both fits in and stands out everywhere from highly formal offices to chic coffeehouses to the local woods. It can be sewn like fabric, formed around shapes like plastic, and carved and engraved like wood or metal.

This versatility in leather's function, aesthetic, and construction is what led me to make it ember creations' main focus to begin with.

Possibly one of my favourite things about leather is that it is one of very few materials that improves in its looks *and* usability as time goes by. It acquires a distinctive character from the way it is used and abused, and the same process makes the leather more supple in the areas it needs to be.
