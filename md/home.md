What I do
---------

*ember creations* is a company run from a shed by one man - Andrew Reece. I make everything by hand, meaning that each product is unique in some way. I am currently selling a small number of stock [leather goods][], and I hope to expand that range and start to sell items I have forged as well.

Customisation
-------------

Because I am making everything by hand, I can change any details that you might want. Prices will change (up or down) according to the time the product takes to make and the changes in material cost.

Unique Designs and Restoration
------------------------------

If you would like to commission me to make or restore something specific, you are welcome to email me at <info@embercreations.co.uk>
